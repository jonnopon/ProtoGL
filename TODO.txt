Changes/Fixes
    - falling platforms work
    - jump is now a double jump (TODO only one if fall off edge)
    - level now reacts better when player is hit
    - player's distance from left edge is like health - recharges when on ground
    - collision is better
    - space to start/resume
    - money disappearing
        - likely something to do with level transition


TODO:
    - problems            
        - collision weirdness from underneath and collision boxes need shrinking
            -- app-specific problem

    - animation
    - background
    - day/night?
    - change Entity base to be given x and y coords for both start and end
        - rect
        - allows scaling, still allows rotation etc
        - can now "scale" by changing the coords of either start or end; allows for simple scaling in one direction only on either axis
    - make everything smaller;
        - increase resolution
        - increase scaling - new method
        - increase speed
    - increase fidelity of jump and overall control
    - new chunks?
    - more excitement
        - moving traps
        - random events
        - world interaction








 ENTITY STRUCTURE
     - ultra abstract Entity, representing anything dyanamic or potentially
         dyanic and/or anything with collision in the game
     - abstract LivingObject
     - abstract InanimateObject
     - abstract behavioural modules?
     - implementation in the form of "Player" or "Coin" etc
