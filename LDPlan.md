###Requirements Left:
    - Overall
        - Even Nicer UI
        - More shapes ?
            - Circle?
        - Fix scaling, it's borked
    - Player control
        - play with new control ideas maybe; acceleration/linear motion?
    - ~~LevelSystem~~
        - ~~Milestone waves, replenishing health and weighing up enemy proportions given multiplier + wave~~
        - Milestone waves should be designed in some way
        - (med priority) randomise a colour across the grid in a wave like pattern
        - (low priority) if time, figure out how to make a 3D net and wing it
    - Enemies
        - Circle?
            - Spawns and heads towards you (but does not follow you, does not bounce off walls)
            - Has a large mult prize for killing it
    - Controls:
        - Rebindable keys
        - B: Bomb??
